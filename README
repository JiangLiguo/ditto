Ditto!!!
---------------
Install:

1. Set environment variable DITTO_ROOT = the folder that contains /diito

2. Compile NEWMAT library for your system. It lies inside /ditto/public_library/algebra/

3. That's it! Most projects links to nothing, sometimes you need to link to OpenGL, sometimes need to link to NEWMAT.
